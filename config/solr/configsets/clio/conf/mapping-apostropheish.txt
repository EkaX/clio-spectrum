# 
# We found that either input documents or queries would
# sometimes contain apostrophe-like characters instead of
# actual apostrophes (single-quotes).
# 
# Solr has some default tokenizing related to apostrophes,
# which doesn't happen for non-apostrophes.
# 
# Since we want all these chars to be treated equivalently,
# we'll simply map them to the same value.

# See details in NEXT-824 - Apostrophe character
